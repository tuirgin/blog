This does not hit close to home. It&rsquo;s dead-on, right to the face.

> Smith confirms the “value of community for the marginalised” before
> letting slip: “You don’t have the luxury of being an individual.” That seems a
> hell of a thing to say… “I mean it. To be black, queer or poor – to be an
> individual has always meant death for us. To be a woman alone is dangerous –
> we teach our daughters that, we teach black people that. Our liberation comes
> through community, organising, collectivising. Individuality has meant death.
> Individuality has meant being marooned. Individuality is a privilege, right?
> The only people who can think of themselves as separate from the other people
> who have made their lives possible are straight white dudes.”

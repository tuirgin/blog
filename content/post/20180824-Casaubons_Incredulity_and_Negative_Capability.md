I first made note of this passage of Umberto Eco&rsquo;s _Foucault&rsquo;s Pendulum_ in 2005. The narrator is Casaubon.

> I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren&rsquo;t trying to teach us. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom. When I was ten, I asked my parents to subscribe to a weekly magazine that was publishing comic-strip versions of the great classics of literature. My father, not because he was stingy, but because he was suspicious of comic strips, tried to beg off. &ldquo;The purpose of this magazine,&rdquo; I pontificated, quoting the ad, &ldquo;is to educate the reader in an entertaining way.&rdquo; &ldquo;The purpose of your magazine,&rdquo; my father replied without looking up from his paper, &ldquo;is the purpose of every magazine: to sell as many copies as it can.&rdquo;

> That day, I began to be incredulous.
>
> Or, rather, I regretted having been credulous. I regretted having allowed myself to be borne away by a passion of the mind. Such is credulity.
>
> Not that the incredulous person doesn&rsquo;t believe in anything. It&rsquo;s just that he doesn&rsquo;t believe in everything. Or he believes in one thing at a time. He believes a second thing only if it somehow follows from the first thing. He is nearsighted and methodical, avoiding wide horizons. If two things don&rsquo;t fit, but you believe both of them, thinking that somewhere, hidden, there must be a third thing that connects them, that&rsquo;s credulity.

> Incredulity doesn&rsquo;t kill curiosity; it encourages it. Though distrustful of logical chains of ideas, I loved the polyphony of ideas. As long as you don&rsquo;t believe in them, the collision of two ideas— both false—can create a pleasing interval, a kind of diabolus in musica. I had no respect for some ideas people were willing to stake their lives on, but two or three ideas that I did not respect might still make a nice melody. Or have a good beat, and if it was jazz, all the better.

> &ldquo;You live on the surface,&rdquo; Lia told me years later. &ldquo;You sometimes seem profound, but it&rsquo;s only because you piece a lot of surfaces together to create the impression of depth, solidity. That solidity would collapse if you tried to stand it up.&rdquo;

Thirteen years later, these excerpts from Matthew Zapruder&rsquo;s _Why Poetry_ caught my attention.

> It was intensely liberating as a writer to realize that the poem is not a place to be categorically convinced of anything. It is a good place to be serially convinced, convinced for a moment, in a line or a stanza or a phrase or even a word. But then to change one&rsquo;s mind. Again and again.

> This is what negative capability means in poetry, to be in the state where you can accept a succession of things, especially if they contradict each other, in order to allow within yourself an experience that you will not have elsewhere in life.

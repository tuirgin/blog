It&rsquo;s been quite a few years since I last spent time on poetry. For
whatever reason I seem to go through cycles where I read and write none
of it, and then it comes back like some kind of need. So, I&rsquo;m re-reading
Glyn Maxwell&rsquo;s _On Poetry_ and doing some of the exercises this time.
The exercises for the first chapter involve taking a number of blank
pages and pretending certain things about them. What follows are my
just-spit-it-out first draft attempts. Just getting the juices flowing
again. <!--more-->

<p class="poem-title">The page is physically hurt by your every word</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="poem-2">This very thing. Being.</p>
<p class="poem-2">A razor&rsquo;s edge. Slicing.</p>
<p class="poem-2">Biting. Tearing into you.</p>
<p class="poem-2">Words thrusting into flesh,</p>
<p class="poem-2">Your blood catching flame,</p>
<p class="poem-2">Burning, till hope gutters out.</p>
</div>


<p class="poem-title">Every mark makes you remember more</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="poem-2">The memory that something had gone before</p>
<p class="poem-2">Something with meaning, subtle importance</p>
<p class="poem-2">Hides at the back of me, lost,</p>
<p class="poem-2">A mosquito bite, itching into memory.</p>
<p class="poem-2">And so, I pick up paper and pen</p>
<p class="poem-2">And scratch, writing to remember:</p>
<p class="poem-2">At first gently, wanting to ignore,</p>
<p class="poem-2">To cause no pain, to avoid it all.</p>
<p class="poem-2">But then the itching turns to burning,</p>
<p class="poem-2">And no subtle demand for release,</p>
<p class="poem-2">Every word ignites a flame</p>
<p class="poem-2">Of recollection, fear, and hope.</p>
</div>

<p class="poem-title">Every mark makes you remember less, like dementia</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="poem-2">Every thought put down</p>
<p class="poem-2">Is a memory spent</p>
<p class="poem-2">And lost forever.</p>
<hr class="fancy" />
<p class="poem-2">And what if this were true?</p>
<p class="poem-2">That we write to forget,</p>
<p class="poem-2">That every word on a page</p>
<p class="poem-2">Is a purging of something violent,</p>
<p class="poem-2">Painful. Claiming freedom</p>
<p class="poem-2">From our ghosts, our selves.</p>
<p class="poem-2">Returning us to empty naivet√©,</p>
<p class="poem-2">Brimming full of possibility.</p>
</div>

<p class="poem-title">That God can only hear you if you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="poem-2">Can you hear me now as I revert to word?</p>
<p class="poem-2">Why is it only in the intentionality of words</p>
<p class="poem-2">Made explicit, visible, naked in their black and whiteness,</p>
<p class="poem-2">When all shades of hope are rendered in striking contrast</p>
<p class="poem-2">When doubt is pared away with commas and end stops,</p>
<p class="poem-2">When all the pallid, wobbling fat of honest uncertainty</p>
<p class="poem-2">Is cut off, and the muscle sharpened like a blade of contemptuous</p>
<p class="poem-2">Certainty and conviction, all artificial in its exactness and precision,</p>
<p class="poem-2">Why is it only then that you can hear me?</p>
</div>


<p class="poem-title">That only touching the page are you hidden from God</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="poem-2">The belly of the whale:</p>
<p class="poem-2d">A hiding place where silence</p>
<p class="poem-2">Is empty and nothing</p>
<p class="poem-2d">Is just nothing and not some</p>
<p class="poem-2">Tolling bell</p>
<p class="poem-2d">Calling all to worship.</p>
<p class="poem-2a">And yet now</p>
<p class="poem-2d">I find myself bending</p>
<p class="poem-2">Knee and head</p>
<p class="poem-2d">To this&mdash;ghastly, stinking&mdash;floor</p>
<p class="poem-2">Unable to not</p>
<p class="poem-2d">Worship you in the abyss.</p>
</div>

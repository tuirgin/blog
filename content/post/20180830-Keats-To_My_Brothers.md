Tonight I read this occasional poem which John Keats wrote on the 17<sup>th</sup> birthday of his brother, Tom.

<div class="poem">
  <p class="poem-title"> To My Brothers </p>
  <p class="poem-line"> Small, busy flames play through the fresh laid coals, </p>
  <p class="poem-line poem-0"> And their faint cracklings o’er our silence creep </p>
  <p class="poem-line poem-0"> Like whispers of the household gods that keep </p>
  <p class="poem-line"> A gentle empire o’er fraternal souls. </p>
  <p class="poem-line">And while, for rhymes, I search around the poles,</p>
  <p class="poem-line poem-0">Your eyes are fix’d, as in poetic sleep,</p>
  <p class="poem-line poem-0">Upon the lore so voluble and deep,</p>
  <p class="poem-line">That aye at fall of night our care condoles.</p>
  <p class="poem-line">This is your birth-day Tom, and I rejoice</p>
  <p class="poem-line poem-0">That thus it passes smoothly, quietly.</p>
  <p class="poem-line">Many such eves of gently whisp’ring noise</p>
  <p class="poem-line poem-0">May we together pass, and calmly try</p>
  <p class="poem-line">What are this world’s true joys,—ere the great voice,</p>
  <p class="poem-line poem-0">From its fair face, shall bid our spirits fly.</p>
  <p class="poem-date"> November 18, 1816 </p>

<!--more-->I find the initial quatrain particularly compelling, the beautiful imagery. I am there. I can see and hear the coals crackling. And then, as the sonnet turns on the 9<sup>th</sup> line, and Keats addresses his brother, Tom—it touches me with such a sense of tenderness and delicacy and hopefulness.

Tom would be dead from tuberculosis in just two years and 13 days. John Keats had a little more than 4 years left.

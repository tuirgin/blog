In _On Poetry_ Glyn Maxwell gives a writing exercise where you draw from a deck
of cards. Each suit prompts a social situation; each value prompts a setting.
Draw a card. Write a stanza. Repeat. Or not.<!--more-->

I drew:

-   **Q♣**: In bed, in a crowd.
-   **K♦**: At table, with a loved one and it&rsquo;s going well.
-   **6♣**: Dawn, in a crowd.
-   **3♠**: Very cold, all alone.

  <p class="poem-line poem-top">There are too many here,</p>
  <p class="poem-line">No comfort found in company,</p>
  <p class="poem-line">Too many competing minds</p>
  <p class="poem-line">Laying here next to you.</p>

  <p class="poem-line poem-top">I spent too much on wine</p>
  <p class="poem-line">Meant for Beef Burgundy.</p>
  <p class="poem-line">But it was good, impressing</p>
  <p class="poem-line">Everyone—your sister, your parents.</p>

  <p class="poem-line poem-top">The morning I had to leave</p>
  <p class="poem-line">Your whole family came</p>
  <p class="poem-line">To see me off—left</p>
  <p class="poem-line">No space to say goodbye.</p>

  <p class="poem-line poem-top">New fallen snow—</p>
  <p class="poem-line">Crisp frozen silence—</p>
  <p class="poem-line">I've nothing now but space</p>
  <p class="poem-line">And time to remember you.</p>

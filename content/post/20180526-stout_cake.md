This chocolate cake is dense and rich, but not overly sweet, especially if it is
divided into 4 layers. It has been Anastasia's birthday cake since she was
little. <!--more-->

Measurements for 8" or 9" pans are provided with all measurements derived from
the original 8 inch volume measurements.

## Directions {#directions}

1.  Heat oven to 325°F. Spray 2 round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray
    (pref. Baker's Friend or other unflavored baking spray). Line bottom with
    parchment paper; spray with nonstick cooking spray and dust with sifted
    unsweetened cocoa.
2.  In medium saucepan, combine stout and cocoa. Add butter; cook over medium
    heat just until butter melts; cool.
3.  In large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, brown sugar, baking soda and salt.
    Add stout mixture; beat at medium speed 1 minute. Add eggs and sour cream;
    beat 2 minutes. Pour batter into pans.
4.  Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
    Cool on wire rack 10 minutes; remove from pans. Remove parchment; cool
    completely.
5.  To make frosting, in medium saucepan, bring whipping cream, stout and corn
    syrup to a boil over medium heat.
6.  Meanwhile, place chocolate and butter in large bowl. Pour hot cream mixture
    over chocolate mixture; let stand 5 minutes. Stir chocolate mixture until
    smooth. Refrigerate 30 to 45 minutes or until of spreading consistency.
7.  Place 1 cake layer on serving plate. Spread with one-third of frosting. Top
    with second cake layer. Frost sides and top of cake with remaining frosting.
    Refrigerate 1 hour or until frosting is set. Store in refrigerator.

    Alternatively, split the cakes into 4 layers. Use approximately half of the
    frosting for the layers, and half for the exterior of the cake. The multiple
    layers better integrates the sweetness of the frosting and lightens the mouth
    feel of the cake.

This dressing makes for great garlic burgers. A small touch on poached eggs
makes for very creamy, garlicky eggs. <!--more-->

The original recipe calls for 2 cloves and complains that most garlic dressings
are not garlicky enough. Two cloves is mild mannered. The 6 cloves my wife calls
for is strong a punch-you-in-the-face assertive. If you prefer an effusive
garlic flavor without the raw sharpness, roast a bulb of garlic drizzled with
olive oil and wrapped in aluminum foil until the garlic flesh is soft---45-60
minutes. Cool and make into a paste with the recipe&rsquo;s salt, then whisk into the
wet ingredients.

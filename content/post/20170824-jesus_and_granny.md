My core moral and ethical convictions as summed up by Jesus and an atheist:<!--more-->

> Jesus: &ldquo;Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.&rdquo;

<p class="work-ref">—Matthew 5:44</p>

> Granny Weatherwax: &ldquo;And sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. That&rsquo;s what sin is...&rdquo;
>
> Omnian priest: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure there are worse crimes...&rdquo;
>
> Granny: &ldquo;But they starts with thinking about people as things...&rdquo;

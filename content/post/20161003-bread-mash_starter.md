## Sourdough Starter {#sourdough-starter}

I maintain a very small amount of starter between bakes---no more than
60--70g---otherwise I just end up with too much waste or stored old starter.
(You can use the old starter this for pancakes, waffles, crackers, and other
things.) However, when building an initial starter, there is benefit to
volume---greater room for error. <!--more-->


### Phase 1 (48 hours) {#phase-1--48-hours}


#### Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   30g mash
-   30g whole wheat and/or rye flour
-   60g spring or filtered water
-   1g diastatic malt powder, or sprouted wheat flour (optional)


#### Steps {#steps}

1.  Stir ingredients and store in a clear glass container. (Plastic gets
    scratched and can hold bacteria. Stainless steel is fine, but you can't
    observe the development of gasses.)
2.  Cover to keep out contaminants.
3.  Stir every 8--12 hours.
4.  Bubbles may begin to appear during this stage.


### Phase 2 (24-48 hours) {#phase-2--24-48-hours}


#### Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   30g mash
-   30g whole wheat and/or rye flour
-   30g spring or filtered water
-   All phase 1 starter


#### Steps {#steps}

1.  Stir and again return to covered clear glass container
2.  Stir every 8-12 hours.
3.  When quite bubbly, or when 48 hours has been reached, go to phase 3.


### Phase 3 (24-48 hours) {#phase-3--24-48-hours}


#### Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   45g whole wheat and/or rye flour
-   30g spring or filtered water
-   100g phase 2 starter


#### Steps {#steps}

1.  Stir and again return to covered clear glass container.
2.  Stir every 8--12 hours.
3.  When bubbly and expanded, move to the next phase.
4.  Hold back unused phase 2 starter as an insurance policy.


### Phase 4 (4-24 hours) {#phase-4--4-24-hours}


#### Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   85g whole wheat and/or rye flour
-   57g spring or filtered water
-   85g phase 3 starter


#### Steps {#steps}

1.  Stir and return to covered clear glass container.
2.  Starter should double within 4--24 hours.
3.  Proceed to use and prepare starter per sourdough recipes.


## Mash {#mash}

This will make well over 300g more than is required for the starter. Adjust measurements
as needed, however may be difficult to work with smaller quantities.


### Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   300g water, 165째F
-   218g whole grain flour, wheat or rye
-   2g diastatic malt powder, or sprouted wheat flour (optional)


### Steps {#steps}

1.  Preheat oven to 200째F
2.  Heat water to 165째F in an ovenproof saucepan
3.  Remove pan from heat and stir in the flour and diastatic malt powder, working
    quickly to avoid excessive loss of heat.
4.  Cover pan and place in oven.
5.  Turn oven down to 150째F, if possible, and leave the mash for 3 hours. If
    the oven cannot be turned low-enough, use the lowest possible temperature
    setting and cycle the oven off and on at a 10 minute cycle. After the first
    hour the heat can be turned off altogether, however if the oven supports a
    low-enough setting leave it on for the entire duration.
6.  Allow the mash to cool, then refrigerate.
